Need to create and review the addon framework which is an extension for the vs code 

This extension gets all the views in one place to boost developer productivity
We should be able to add any ci or cd or scm tool on the go 

Provide with ideal framwork
ChatGPT said:
Here's an ideal framework for building a pluggable, productivity-focused VS Code extension (add-on framework) that aggregates all key development views‚ÄîCI, CD, SCM, etc.‚Äîin one unified interface. It should be modular, scalable, and user-friendly, with dynamic plugin integration capability.

‚úÖ Goals
Provide a single pane of glass to developers: CI/CD status, SCM, build pipeline, logs, etc.

Allow plug-and-play modules for tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket, etc.

Enable easy config and quick navigation without leaving the VS Code environment.

üß© Ideal Add-On Framework Architecture
1. Core Extension (Base Layer)
Handles the skeleton and provides APIs to register, render, and communicate between views.

Key Components:
Extension Host API Interface

Plugin Registry

Global State & Settings Store

Panel Manager (WebView + TreeView + Sidebar)

Telemetry & Logging

2. Plugin Modules (Dynamic Add-ons)
Each plugin corresponds to a CI/CD/SCM tool. Plugins can be added/removed independently.

Plugin Manifest:
{
  "name": "GitHubActions",
  "type": "ci",
  "entry": "main.js",
  "configSchema": { ... },
  "icon": "gh-icon.svg"
}
Plugin Capabilities:
Render custom views (WebView or TreeView)

Register commands

Fetch statuses/logs via APIs

Define settings (auth tokens, endpoints)

3. Plugin Loader & Registry
Loads external plugins on demand.

Looks up plugin directory or config

Validates manifest

Loads plugin into isolated context

Registers plugin UI in the sidebar panel

4. Unified Sidebar View
Single VS Code panel with tabs or collapsible sections for each plugin/tool.

Example layout:

-------------------------
|  All-in-One Dev Panel |
|-----------------------|
|  ‚ñ∏ GitHub Actions     |
|  ‚ñ∏ Jenkins Builds     |
|  ‚ñæ Git Repos          |
|     - Branches        |
|     - PRs             |
|  ‚ñæ Logs               |
|     - Console         |
|     - Errors          |
|-----------------------|
5. Configuration UI
Each plugin can define its own settings UI using VS Code's contributes.configuration.

Global settings include:

Default CI tool

Polling interval

Theme integration

6. Communication Bus
Lightweight event/message system (like EventEmitter) between core and plugins.

Use Case:

Jenkins plugin triggers event on failed build

SCM plugin listens and shows "‚ö†Ô∏è Latest commit failed in CI"

7. Authentication Support
Common auth handler for:

OAuth2 (GitHub, GitLab)

Token-based (Jenkins, Bitbucket)

Secrets management

üîß Tech Stack
Language: TypeScript

UI: WebView + TreeView + VS Code APIs

Packaging: vsce (Visual Studio Code Extension CLI)

Plugin Management: JSON manifest, sandboxed modules

State: vscode.workspaceState or globalState

üß™ Sample Plugin Interface (TypeScript)
interface AddonPlugin {
  id: string;
  type: 'ci' | 'cd' | 'scm';
  activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): void;

Offline Support: Cache plugin data and minimize API calls.

Dev Panel Chatbot: Add GPT-style command assistant in the panel.

Would you like a starter GitHub repo template or a working extension.ts boilerplate to begin development?

You said:
provide sample project and code.. in order to show alerts from dashboards.. it could be any monitoring tool but code should be generic as possible
ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a sample VS Code extension project that shows alerts from a generic monitoring dashboard:

‚úÖ Features:
Adds a custom sidebar panel

Fetches mock alerts (easily replaceable with API calls to tools like Prometheus, Datadog, or New Relic)

Renders alerts with status-based styling

Supports manual refresh via a VS Code command

üîÑ Next Steps:
Replace fetchAlerts() with an actual API call (fetch/XHR) to your monitoring tool.

Optionally add configuration settings (like API keys) using contributes.configuration.

Would you like a ZIP of the entire project folder or a GitHub repo structure for it?

You said:
problem here is we need to have different api calls how will it be add on or extensible to other dashbaords
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî to make this extensible for different dashboards/tools, the design needs to abstract the alert provider so that additional APIs (like Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana, CloudWatch, etc.) can be plugged in without modifying the core.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Design for Extensibility
1. Define a Common Interface for Alert Providers
// alertProvider.ts
export interface Alert {
  id: string;
  status: 'CRITICAL' | 'WARNING' | 'INFO';
  message: string;
  source: string;
}

export interface AlertProvider {
  getAlerts(): Promise<Alert[]>;
  getName(): string;
}
2. Create Individual Providers
Each one implements the interface, wrapping a different dashboard/tool.

// prometheusProvider.ts
import { AlertProvider, Alert } from './alertProvider';

export class PrometheusProvider implements AlertProvider {
  async getAlerts(): Promise<Alert[]> {
    // Replace with actual Prometheus API call
    return fetch('http://localhost:9090/api/v1/alerts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => data.data.alerts.map((a: any) => ({
        id: a.labels.alertname,
        status: a.labels.severity.toUpperCase(),
        message: a.annotations.description,
        source: 'Prometheus'
      })));
  }

  getName(): string {
    return 'Prometheus';
  }
}
// datadogProvider.ts
import { AlertProvider, Alert } from './alertProvider';

export class DatadogProvider implements AlertProvider {
  async getAlerts(): Promise<Alert[]> {
    // Replace with actual Datadog API call and key
    return fetch('https://api.datadoghq.com/api/v1/events?api_key=XXX')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => data.events.map((e: any) => ({
        id: e.id,
        status: 'INFO',
        message: e.text,
        source: 'Datadog'
      })));
  }

  getName(): string {
    return 'Datadog';
  }
}
3. Dynamic Provider Selection
Based on user configuration (settings.json or quick pick), you choose the provider dynamically.

// providerRegistry.ts
import { AlertProvider } from './alertProvider';
import { PrometheusProvider } from './prometheusProvider';
import { DatadogProvider } from './datadogProvider';

export function getProvider(name: string): AlertProvider {
  switch (name) {
    case 'Prometheus':
      return new PrometheusProvider();
    case 'Datadog':
      return new DatadogProvider();
    default:
      throw new Error('Unknown provider: ' + name);
  }
}
4. Allow User Configuration
In package.json of the extension:

"contributes": {
  "configuration": {
    "properties": {
      "alertDashboard.provider": {
        "type": "string",
        "default": "Prometheus",
        "enum": ["Prometheus", "Datadog"],
        "description": "Select which alerting dashboard to use"
      }
    }
  }
}
Then in the panel:

import { getProvider } from './providerRegistry';

const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('alertDashboard');
const provider = getProvider(config.get('provider') || 'Prometheus');
const alerts = await provider.getAlerts();
‚úÖ Benefits of This Design
Feature	Benefit
Modular	New dashboards can be added as plugins without core change
Pluggable	Future providers like CloudWatch, Grafana just implement the interface
Configurable	User chooses provider from VS Code Settings
Extensible	Easily enhanced with filtering, alert actions, grouped views, etc.
Would you like me to update the code with this structure in your textdoc, or generate a GitHub-ready boilerplate with Prometheus + Datadog support out of the box?

You said:
without implementation can we make it configurable so that be it kibana grafana or any dashboard may be user fills in details and that enables dashboard and configure APIs to get the alerts for that project
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî you can make the extension dashboard-agnostic and user-configurable without hardcoding any specific implementation (like Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, etc.).

The core idea:
üß† Treat dashboards as dynamic configurations, and allow the user to define API endpoints + parsing logic (or a script path) per project or tool.

‚úÖ Ideal Design: Configurable, Tool-Agnostic Alert Panel
1. User Configuration in settings.json
Allow the user to configure dashboards via settings:

// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "alertDashboard.providers": [
    {
      "name": "Grafana Alerts",
      "baseUrl": "https://grafana.example.com/api/alerts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:GRAFANA_API_KEY}"
      },
      "parseScript": "${workspaceFolder}/scripts/parseGrafana.js"
    },
    {
      "name": "Kibana Alerts",
      "baseUrl": "https://kibana.example.com/api/alerts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "ApiKey ${env:KIBANA_API_KEY}"
      },
      "parseScript": "${workspaceFolder}/scripts/parseKibana.js"
    }
  ]
}
parseScript is a JS file the user writes that receives the raw JSON and returns a uniform alert list.

2. Generic Fetcher
async function fetchAlertsFrom(config: any): Promise<Alert[]> {
  const response = await fetch(config.baseUrl, {
    headers: config.headers
  });
  const rawData = await response.json();

  const parseFn = require(config.parseScript);
  return parseFn(rawData);
}
3. Example parseGrafana.js Script
// scripts/parseGrafana.js
module.exports = function parse(rawData) {
  return rawData.alerts.map(a => ({
    id: a.id,
    status: a.state.toUpperCase(),
    message: a.message || a.labels.alertname,
    source: 'Grafana'
  }));
};
4. Benefits
Feature	Benefit
üß© Plug-and-play	Any dashboard with an API can be added
üõ†Ô∏è No hardcoding	No code change needed for new tools
üß† Flexible parsing	Custom logic per tool via user-provided JS
üîí Secrets support	Use ${env:KEY} for secure tokens
üß™ Optional Enhancements
Add a UI selector to choose which dashboard to view

Validate config schema on load

Use a default parser for common tools (e.g. Prometheus, Datadog)

üß± Want me to scaffold this architecture in your code now?
This would include:

AlertFetcher.ts (generic loader)

settings.json sample

Placeholder parse script

Integration in the panel view

Let me know ‚Äî I can generate a plug-and-play project template based on this pattern.

You said:
parsescript cannot be in a path it has to be configured using settings or any other way it is security risk to parse from user's path/folder
ChatGPT said:
You're 100% right ‚Äî allowing JS to be loaded dynamically from the workspace folder (require(parseScript)) poses a serious security risk, especially in multi-user or remote workspaces.

‚úÖ Secure Alternative to Parse Scripts
üéØ Goal:
Allow users to configure how to parse alerts without executing arbitrary scripts from disk.

üîê Solution: Use JSON-based Parsing Rules Instead of Scripts
Instead of allowing JS code execution, use declarative parsing rules in settings.json.

Example Configuration (Safe)
{
  "alertDashboard.providers": [
    {
      "name": "Grafana",
      "baseUrl": "https://grafana.example.com/api/alerts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:GRAFANA_API_KEY}"
      },
      "parsingRules": {
        "listPath": "alerts",
        "idPath": "id",
        "statusPath": "state",
        "messagePath": "message"
      }
    }
  ]
}
üîß Generic Parser Logic (in extension code)
type Alert = {
  id: string;
  status: string;
  message: string;
  source: string;
};

function extractValue(obj: any, path: string): any {
  return path.split('.').reduce((o, key) => o?.[key], obj);
}

function parseAlerts(rawData: any, config: any): Alert[] {
  const list = extractValue(rawData, config.parsingRules.listPath) || [];

  return list.map((item: any) => ({
    id: extractValue(item, config.parsingRules.idPath),
    status: extractValue(item, config.parsingRules.statusPath).toUpperCase(),
    message: extractValue(item, config.parsingRules.messagePath),
    source: config.name
  }));
}
You now have a secure, configurable, and dynamic system for supporting multiple dashboards without ever executing arbitrary code.

üîÑ Future Extensions (Still Secure)
Add support for value transformations (e.g., mappings for severity)

Add optional regex-based filtering or trimming

Support environment-specific settings for headers/base URLs

‚úÖ Summary
Feature	Approach Used
Dynamic dashboards	Config in settings.json
Safe parsing	JSON-based path rules (not JS code)
Extendable	Add parsing logic in code, not config
Secure	No eval, require, or disk JS loading
Would you like me to update your current VS Code extension project to follow this model, including a sample settings.json, parser logic, and provider loop?

You said:
how do we ask user to configure the jsonc
ChatGPT said:
To ask the user to configure the settings.json with the alertDashboard.providers safely and intuitively, follow this plan:

‚úÖ 1. Define Configuration Schema in package.json
Inside your extension/package.json, declare the alertDashboard.providers as an array of objects:

"contributes": {
  "configuration": {
    "title": "Alert Dashboard",
    "properties": {
      "alertDashboard.providers": {
        "type": "array",
        "description": "List of alert dashboard providers",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Display name of the provider" },
            "baseUrl": { "type": "string", "description": "Base API endpoint URL" },
            "headers": {
              "type": "object",
              "description": "Optional HTTP headers like API keys",
              "additionalProperties": { "type": "string" }
            },
            "parsingRules": {
              "type": "object",
              "description": "Path mapping to extract data from API response",
              "properties": {
                "listPath": { "type": "string" },
                "idPath": { "type": "string" },
                "statusPath": { "type": "string" },
                "messagePath": { "type": "string" }
              },
              "required": ["listPath", "idPath", "statusPath", "messagePath"]
            }
          },
          "required": ["name", "baseUrl", "parsingRules"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
‚úÖ This enables IntelliSense, validation, and tooltips inside settings.json.

‚úÖ 2. Prompt the User with a Command to Add Provider
Register a command like alertDashboard.addProvider, which when run:

Opens settings.json in editor

Inserts a boilerplate config if not already present

vscode.commands.registerCommand('alertDashboard.addProvider', async () => {
  const settings = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('alertDashboard');
  const providers = settings.get('providers') || [];

  if (!Array.isArray(providers)) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage("Invalid providers format in settings.");
    return;
  }

  const newProvider = {
    name: "Example Dashboard",
    baseUrl: "https://api.example.com/alerts",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:YOUR_API_KEY}"
    },
    parsingRules: {
      listPath: "alerts",
      idPath: "id",
      statusPath: "severity",
      messagePath: "description"
    }
  };

  await settings.update(
    'providers',
    [...providers, newProvider],
    vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Workspace
  );

  vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Provider configuration added to settings.json.');
});
‚úÖ 3. Command Palette Entry
In your package.json:

"commands": [
  {
    "command": "alertDashboard.addProvider",
    "title": "Alert Dashboard: Add Provider"
  }
]
üß† 4. Bonus: Show an Info Message on First Activation
On first run or when no providers are configured:

const providers = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('alertDashboard').get('providers');
if (!providers || !Array.isArray(providers) || providers.length === 0) {
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
    'No alert providers configured. Run "Alert Dashboard: Add Provider" to get started.'
  );
}
‚úÖ Summary
Step	Purpose
1. Define schema	Enables IntelliSense in settings.json
2. Command to add	Simplifies first-time setup
3. Palette entry	Accessible UX
4. On-activate prompt	Friendly reminder to configure
Would you like the schema and command logic injected into your codebase now? I can update your project‚Äôs package.json and backend logic accordingly.

You said:
again explain each step how will user configure add-on plugin with above
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide for how a user would configure the add-on VS Code extension using the secure and extensible JSON-based model we discussed ‚Äî no code, no JS scripts, no risk.

üéØ Goal Recap
We want to allow the user to add any dashboard or monitoring tool (like Grafana, Kibana, Prometheus, etc.) on the fly, securely and without modifying the extension‚Äôs code.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Flow: How the User Adds a New Dashboard Provider
üß© Step 1: Install & Activate the Extension
The user installs your VS Code extension. On first activation:

VS Code detects that no alert providers are configured

It shows a message:

"No alert providers configured. Run Alert Dashboard: Add Provider to set one up."

‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Run the "Add Provider" Command
The user opens the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and runs:

Alert Dashboard: Add Provider
This command does the following:

Automatically adds a template provider config to the workspace's settings.json

Shows a success message:

"Provider configuration added to settings.json. Please update baseUrl and parsing paths."

üìù Step 3: Edit Configuration in .vscode/settings.json
VS Code opens or highlights the config inside .vscode/settings.json:

{
  "alertDashboard.providers": [
    {
      "name": "Grafana Alerts",
      "baseUrl": "https://grafana.example.com/api/alerts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:GRAFANA_API_KEY}"
      },
      "parsingRules": {
        "listPath": "alerts",
        "idPath": "id",
        "statusPath": "state",
        "messagePath": "message"
      }
    }
  ]
}
The user edits:

baseUrl to point to the API of their dashboard (e.g., Grafana, Kibana, etc.)

Optionally adds headers (e.g., auth tokens via ${env:...})

Sets parsingRules to help the extension know where to extract:

the list of alerts (listPath)

each alert‚Äôs ID, status, and message

üîÅ Step 4: Extension Fetches & Displays Alerts
Now, when the extension runs:

It reads this config

Makes a call to the baseUrl with provided headers

Parses the JSON based on parsingRules

Shows alerts in the custom view panel

üìå Example: If the API response is:
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "state": "critical",
      "message": "Disk usage exceeded"
    }
  ]
}
Then this config works:

"parsingRules": {
  "listPath": "alerts",
  "idPath": "id",
  "statusPath": "state",
  "messagePath": "message"
}
‚úÖ Benefits to the User
Feature	Benefit
üß† No coding	Just fill JSON paths and URLs
üîê Secure	No script execution, no unsafe code
‚öôÔ∏è Flexible	Works for any REST API dashboard
üì¶ Scalable	User can add multiple providers per workspace
üß∞ Optional Enhancements (Future UX)
Allow JSON validation when saving

Add a small setup wizard UI instead of settings.json

Let user test connection before saving config

Would you like me to now generate:

A working starter extension using this setup?

Or just provide the updated package.json + extension code snippets?

You said:
getting error find json with comments
ChatGPT said:
You're getting the ‚Äúfind JSON with comments‚Äù error because VS Code treats settings.json as JSONC (JSON with Comments), while your extension code is trying to parse it as plain JSON. JSONC allows comments and trailing commas, but JSON.parse() (used internally by most JavaScript code) does not support them.

‚úÖ Fix Options
‚úÖ Option 1: Use VS Code API (Preferred & Safe)
Use the vscode.workspace.getConfiguration() method ‚Äî it already parses settings.json correctly.

You're already doing this in extension.ts:

const settings = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('alertDashboard');
const providers = settings.get<any[]>('providers');
üìå Make sure you're not reading or parsing .vscode/settings.json manually like this:

// ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
const raw = fs.readFileSync('.vscode/settings.json');
const config = JSON.parse(raw.toString());
‚úÖ Option 2: Use a JSONC Parser (Only if you must read file manually)
Install the JSONC parser:

npm install jsonc-parser
Use it like:

import * as fs from 'fs';
import { parse } from 'jsonc-parser';

const content = fs.readFileSync('.vscode/settings.json', 'utf8');
const config = parse(content); // handles comments & trailing commas
üîí Best Practice for Your Extension
Since VS Code provides the API workspace.getConfiguration() for extension settings, always use that. It will:

Safely handle JSONC

Respect workspace/global overrides

Avoid any security or parsing issues

Would you like me to update your extension.ts and fetcher.ts to ensure this is handled safely?

Similar to the architecture used in the Alert Dashboard extension, the goal is to design a generic, secure, and extensible framework where each tool integration is defined via configuration ‚Äî not code.

Current State
Users currently modify .txt or .js files directly to integrate tools.

This leads to security risks, such as executing arbitrary code from local files or paths.

The system lacks validation or UI support for adding/removing tools safely.

Concerns
Security risk: Direct code editing and script execution can introduce vulnerabilities.

Maintenance challenge: Manual file edits make version control and debugging harder.

Limitations
Tools like Jenkins, Azure, or Grafana don‚Äôt follow a standard protocol or schema for integration.

Each tool often requires specific headers, authentication, and response parsing logic.

Fully generic configuration is challenging without exposing low-level control to the user.

Proposed Solution
Use .vscode/settings.json or a central config file with structured JSON definitions for each tool.

Support API details, authentication, and parsing rules via config ‚Äî no code changes required.

Validate config entries at runtime to ensure secure and predictable integration.

Let me know if you'd like this added to your leadership document or need a visual flow of how plugins would register and interact with NeoCrux.

give the alert dashboard solution and explain in detail

ChatGPT said:
Here is the Alert Dashboard Extension Solution explained in detail ‚Äî this can serve as the model architecture for your ideal add-on framework in NeoCrux.

‚úÖ Alert Dashboard Solution: Overview
The Alert Dashboard is a VS Code extension that allows developers to integrate any monitoring tool (Grafana, Kibana, etc.) and fetch alerts without writing or modifying any code. Instead, tool-specific configuration is stored in .vscode/settings.json.

This makes the extension:

üîå Plug-and-play: Add/remove tools easily

üîê Secure: No execution of local scripts or unverified code

‚öôÔ∏è Generic: Works with any REST-compatible tool

üì¶ Key Components
Component	Purpose
settings.json	User-defined configuration for each tool (API URL, headers, rules)
extension.ts	Registers the VS Code command, loads config, and calls fetcher module
fetcher.ts	Calls the API, applies parsing rules, and returns alerts
üß© Configuration-Driven Example (settings.json)
{
  "alertDashboard.providers": [
    {
      "name": "Grafana Alerts",
      "baseUrl": "https://grafana.example.com/api/alerts",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:GRAFANA_API_KEY}"
      },
      "parsingRules": {
        "listPath": "alerts",
        "idPath": "id",
        "statusPath": "state",
        "messagePath": "message"
      }
    }
  ]
}
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Tool Added via Configuration
User adds a new provider in settings.json with API endpoint, optional headers, and JSON parsing instructions.

No code change is required.

2. Command Execution
User runs Alert Dashboard: Add Provider from the command palette.

The extension reads all providers from the config using VS Code‚Äôs settings API (getConfiguration()).

3. Secure API Fetching
The fetcher module:

Builds headers (e.g., API keys from env variables)

Calls the configured baseUrl

Parses the JSON response using the specified paths

Returns the alerts as a standard structure: { id, status, message, source }

4. Flexible UI
In the base version, alerts are printed to the console.

A TreeView or WebView can be added to display alerts inside the VS Code sidebar or panel.

üîí Security Considerations
Concern	Mitigation
Script injection	No script parsing or path-based execution allowed
API Key exposure	Keys are pulled from environment variables (${env:KEY})
JSONC parsing	Uses VS Code‚Äôs native settings API to safely read JSON with comments
üîÑ Benefits
‚úÖ Scalable: Add any number of tools with different formats

‚úÖ Maintainable: No need to edit core code per integration

‚úÖ Safe: Only fetches from user-specified trusted endpoints

‚úÖ Reusable: Common parsing logic applies across tools

üß± Why It‚Äôs a Model for NeoCrux Add-on Framework
The same pattern can be applied to integrate:

CI tools like Jenkins, Azure Pipelines

CD tools

SCM platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos

Monitoring tools like Grafana, Kibana, Datadog

Each integration would be a config entry ‚Äî not a code patch.

Would you like me to create a visual diagram of this architecture and show how it maps to CI/CD/SCM plugins next?
